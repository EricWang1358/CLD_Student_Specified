We initialize an empty set `leaders` to store the indices of leader instructions and an empty list `basic_blocks` to store the resulting basic blocks.\n\n2. In step 1, we iterate over the instructions and determine the leaders:\n   - The first instruction (index 0) is always a leader.\n   - Any instruction that is a jump target (`instr.is_jump_target`) is a leader.\n   - Any instruction that immediately follows a jump instruction (`instructions[i-1].is_jump`) is a leader.\n\n3. In step 2, we build the basic blocks:\n   - We iterate over the instructions again and append each instruction to the `current_block` list.\n   - If the next instruction is a leader (its index is in the `leaders` set) or we have reached the last instruction, we append the `current_block` to the `basic_blocks` list and start a new empty `current_block`.\n\n4. Finally, we return the list of basic blocks.\n\nNote: This implementation assumes that the instructions are represented as objects with `is_jump_target` and `is_jump` attributes indicating whether an instruction is a jump target or a jump instruction, respectively.\n\nYou can call this function with your sequence of three-address instructions to obtain the list of basic blocks.",
